# Eye_Mouse
This project uses OpenCV (CV2) to create a hands-free mouse control system based on eye movements. It detects eye blinks via real-time facial landmark tracking, and each blink triggers a mouse click. The system tracks eye movements to position the cursor and provides click functionality through deliberate blinks using blink detection algorithms.
